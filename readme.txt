QazyWP is a Image Lazy Loader for all WordPress Post Types - Built off Narayan Prusty's <a href="https://github.com/narayanprusty/Qazy" target="_blank">Qazy library</a>

Qazy is a image lazy loader and is library agnostic (no jQuery).

Qazy removes the <a href="http://qnimate.com/lazy-loading-images-and-its-seo-impact/" target="_blank">negative SEO impact</a>. This is what makes it different from other lazy loaders.

Load the script as soon as possible in the webpage so that it can start tracking the images and load them lazily.
